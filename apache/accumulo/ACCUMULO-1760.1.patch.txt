+    Please include the ticket number at the beginning of the log message, and

+    [Zach Holman's talk](http://zachholman.com/talk/more-git-and-github-secrets/)
+    (specifically slides 78-98, beginning at 15:20 into the video). Essentially,
+    leave a short descriptive message in the first line, skip a line, and write
+    more detailed stuff there, if you need to. For example:
+
+    `ACCUMULO-2194 Add delay for randomwalk Security teardown`
+
+    `If two Security randomwalk tests run back-to-back, the second test may see that the
+    table user still exists even though it was removed when the first test was torn down.
+    This can happen if the user drop does not propagate through Zookeeper quickly enough.
+    This commit adds a delay to the end of the Security test to give ZK some time.`
